I majored in control and instrumentation (electrical engineering) from the [University of Khartoum](https://www.uofk.edu/index.php/en/) (Sudan), and then extrapolated on that to control theory in man and machines in my MSc on [Cybernetics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cybernetics) from the [University of Reading](http://www.reading.ac.uk/) (UK). 

Passionate about learning, my journey from a student, to a teaching assistant and then a lecturer at the Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering at the [University of Khartoum](https://www.uofk.edu/index.php/en/), came about developing soft and hard technical skills from both voluntary and academic work; projects and specialized courses; in person and on line. I started my PhD journey with the [H3ABioNet](https://h3abionet.org/) node of Sudan ([Center for Bioinformatics and Systems Biology](https://cbsb.uofk.edu/)), targeting the areas of statistical and mathematical methods of data analysis in [Genome Wide Association Studies (GWAS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genome-wide_association_study) and [Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_sequencing#Next-generation_methods).
In a month or so, I will be heading to the Netherlands, on a double PhD agreement between my home [University of Khartoum](https://www.uofk.edu/index.php/en/) and the [University of Groningen](https://www.rug.nl/?lang=en).

Excited about the future, this is a perfect match to my third-culture upbrining. All in all, this gives the liberty to call my self any title I actually yearn: An _engineer_ (by education), _bioscientist_ (by research), _educator_ (by profession), and my favorite: _a human being_ ! 
Welcome to my space!
