The code is simple. Just add a col class to your image, and another class specifying the width: one, two, or three columns wide. 
<div class="img_row">
    <img class="col one left" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/1.jpg" alt="" title="example image"/>
    <img class="col one left" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/2.jpg" alt="" title="example image"/>
    <img class="col one left" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/3.jpg" alt="" title="example image"/>
</div>
<div class="col three caption">
    Caption photos easily. On the left, a road goes through a tunnel. Middle, leaves artistically fall in a hipster photoshoot. Right, in another hipster photoshoot, a lumberjack grasps a handful of pine needles.
</div>
