- _Build my [`places`](/places) page:_ 
  I like to be able to show places I visited, with some annotations on when/why or even a nice photo. A `location map` is nicely implemented in the [academicpages](https://academicpages.github.io/) theme, so check if you could adopt here. Code is [here](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.ipynb), and is under MIT license

> After looking into this, I realize python is not my strenght, and I'd rather use a language where I'm confident. Will keep the python code (for now), but will eventually dump it for R. [Here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/35386124/embedding-a-r-leaflet-map-on-a-jekyll-site-hosted-on-github) are some helping hints
