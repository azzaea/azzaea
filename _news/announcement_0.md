After lingering in my to-do list for so long, this site has finally come to live. I'm glad I took the step, though looking at a reasonably long list of remaining tasks. For the sake of optimism, I will call it my *wish list*! See below!

The real reason is of course, besides being a valid procrastination execuse, is that I'm recently working on another Jekyll bases site for the [Standard Operating Procedures](https://h3abionet.github.io/H3ABionet-SOPs/) of the [H3ABioNet consortium](https://h3abionet.org/), and it seems such a loss not extending the scope to my own thing- since I'm learning anyways.

#### Wish list
<ul>
    <li>_Show my `[publications](publications)`:_ [Jekyll Scholr plugin](https://github.com/inukshuk/jekyll-scholar) does not play nicely with [Github pages](https://pages.github.com/), so it is rather a challenge to show [publications](publications) in categories. I would like this freedom, hence I'm planning to move to [cloudfare]() at some point </li>
    <li>_Migrate my old `blog`:_ Sometime ago, I used to have [another blog](https://azzaeahmed.wordpress.com/). While yes, it is all personal stuff anyways, I don't feel right about throwing it away or duplication. My simple plan is to follow handy tips from [here](https://girliemac.com/blog/2013/12/27/wordpress-to-jekyll/) or [here](https://benjamintravis.com/blog/jekyll-github-pages-from-wordpress)</li>
    <li>_Adding `places`_: I like to be able to show places I visited, with some annotations on when/why or even a nice photo.</li>
    <li>_Adding courses to `[teaching](teaching)`:_ I only mashed up some random content for my courses [here](teaching). Clean up is obviously needed </li>
    <li> _`Tags` :exclamation:_ I find a blog meaningless if not sortable easily. Would like to be able to use tags in my blog posts or long announcements </li>
</ul>

Strangely, nothing is a better conclusion than the original quote coming with this page! With it I leave you!

> We do not grow absolutely, chronologically. We grow sometimes in one dimension, and not in another, unevenly. We grow partially. We are relative. We are mature in one realm, childish in another.
